# mkdsdecomp

> A work-in-progress decompilation project of Mario Kart DS

[libntr](libntr) serves as a decompilation of Nintendo's SDK code/libs, while [mkds](mkds) contains actual MKDS-specific code, as long as I'm able to tell them apart ;)

Everything uses `devKitPro` to compile, but no external libs like standard-C or libnds.

## Done

- Memory allocator

- Most of the CRT0

## Pending

- Everything else :P
