This repository contains my reverse-engineering work of the *European version* of **Mario Kart DS** (game code `AMCP`): ASM-hacking, better understanding of yet not fully documented DS/MKDS formats, additional tools (like a save editor) and hopefully more:

## Save editor

Reversing [save-data formats and encryption/decryption](tools/common) allowed me to create an almost fully-featured [online Mario Kart DS save editor](https://xortroll.github.io/mkds-re/):

## ASM-hacking

Check out the [ASM-hacking examples](asmhack-examples) for more detailed information on how to inject custom code in MKDS, using generated [headers](re-export/include) and [symbols](re-export/mkds-eu-decomp-symbols.x) of my reverse-engineering work on this game.

## Command-line utility

For practical purposes (to make my life easier) I made a simple command-line tool, [mkdsutil](tools/mkdsutil), in order to work with several MKDS formats in a more straightforward way (better than staring into a hex editor).

It currently has the following features:

- Decrypt and/or encrypt save data

- Print info/fields of decrypted save data

You will need [CMake](https://cmake.org/) in order to compile it, without any external dependencies other than standard C++.

If you wish to make your own tools or extend these ones, you may be interested in [the C++ code](tools/common) covering various MKDS formats and utils.
