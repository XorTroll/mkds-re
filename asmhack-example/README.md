# MKDS ASM-hack example

This example uses header/symbols generated by this project to create MKDS ASM hacks

## Build

[devkitPro and devkitARM](https://devkitpro.org/) are needed (like with most DS homebrew), and the `arm-none-eabi-*` tools (like `arm-none-eabi-gcc`) need to be added to PATH

Extract `header.bin` (at least first `0x200` header bytes), `arm9.bin` and `arm9ovt.bin` from a Mario Kart DS (EU) ROM and place them inside `fs-data`. (hopefully this will soon be automated by [NitroEdit](https://github.com/XorTroll/NitroEdit))

Run [`ncpatcher`](https://github.com/TheGameratorT/NCPatcher) in this directory, which will modify the binaries (while also saving backups of the original ones in a separate directory)

Import arm9.bin` and `arm9ovt.bin` in a Mario Kart DS (EU) ROM (another thing soon to be automated)

> [NSMBe5](https://github.com/MammaMiaTeam/NSMB-Editor) may be used for manual extraction/importing of ROM binaries

Enjoy!

## Example ASM hacks

- Change the default initial scene of the game (thus the game would start on a different place instead of in the `Logo` scene, aka initial credits)

- Custom racer name drawing in grand prix bottom screen, etc
