# `Logo` scene

The `Logo` scene is the first scene shown in the game. After a fade in, it will show the initial "Nintendo" and "All rights reserved (...)" graphics over a black screen, then fade out, perform save-data loading and checking, and jump to the `Title` scene.

## Initialization

The display is configured. An object is allocated for this context specially.

The aforementioned graphics are read and loaded into memory, and a pointer to `common.bmg` is kept in order to use some of its strings.
