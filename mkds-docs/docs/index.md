# Mario Kart DS (EU) reverse-engineering

Hi! I'm [XorTroll](https://github.com/XorTroll), welcome to my **Mario Kart DS (EU)** documentation!

This page documents all about the game's functiobality. It will be progresivelly filled as a broader part of the project is fully decompiled/reversed/understood ;)

Feel free to check the existing tools and code at the [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/XorTroll/mkdsdecomp).

> Would you like to use decompilated resources to make ASM-hacks? [Check the examples](https://github.com/XorTroll/mkdsdecomp/tree/main/asmhack-examples)!

> Check out our [Mario Kart DS save editor](save-editor/)!
